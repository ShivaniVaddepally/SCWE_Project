# SCWE_Project
📌 Self-Calibrated Weighted Ensemble (SCWE)
🔍 Overview

This repository contains my Round-1 Developer Project, where I propose a new method called SCWE (Self-Calibrated Weighted Ensemble).
SCWE improves classification performance on both balanced and imbalanced datasets by:

Calibrating each base model’s probability predictions.

Assigning weights to models based on validation ROC-AUC.

Blending predictions using these weights.

Optimizing the decision threshold for maximum F1-score.

The project is fully reproducible, with code, outputs, and templates for the report & case study.

🚀 Features

✅ Novel algorithm (SCWE)

✅ Handles imbalanced data robustly

✅ Produces ROC, PR, Calibration, and Confusion Matrix plots

✅ Exports metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC) to CSV

✅ Ready-to-use report and case study templates

✅ Easy to extend to custom datasets
